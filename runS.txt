"dev/ttyS0" is the special file for the serial port known as COM1 in the windows world

1 Add user to dialout for full access to serial ports

        Run The following commands
                            - sudo groupadd dialout
                            - sudo gpasswd -a USER dialout
                            - sudo usermod -a -G dialout USER




2 run this command everytime after opening the arduino ide to allow access to the port
                            - sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0 


3 first follow the instruction to installing and creating a venv so that all dependencies are installed within the cwd not necesarry but highly recommended

4 now open vs studio code then install the pyserial module 

    specify the :
            - buad rate =  (default usually 9600)

            - port = "dev/ttyACM0"

5 ensure that the serial monitor is off within the arduino ide to allow python to intercept the data


6 vwallla it works
